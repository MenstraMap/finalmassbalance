    <h1>A company by women for women. </h1>
    We know what it is like to get your period, go to the nearest bathroom, and find there is no menstrual product available. The stress and inconvenience of going home to grab what should have been given in the workplace is exactly why we created MenstraMap. We are a company that was made to empower menstruators to take control of their period journey and hold businesses accountable if they are going to provide free product. <br><br>We hope you love our product, and we wish you many peaceful periods. xxx. Sona, Summer, Mirna, and Jennah
